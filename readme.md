# Introduction

## What is Nirvana

"Nirvana" is a research open-source project of the operating system,
based on some new principles.

For details see the [wiki](https://github.com/nirvanaos/home/wiki/Introduction).

## Current state

Development is still at the pre-MVP stage. Currently are implemented:

- Runtime library

- Memory manager

- Scheduler

- The IDL compiler

- Object-oriented access to file system as a part of the CORBA Naming
  Service.

- POSIX subsystem

- C runtime library

All that you can do currently is build and run tests.

The main supermodule for building with MS Visual Studio 2022/2019 is
[here](https://github.com/nirvanaos/nirvana.vc).

Also you can have a look on [IDL compiler front-end
library](https://github.com/nirvanaos/idlfe).

I'm very interested in the enthusiasts who will help me in the
development. If you want to participate, e-mail me:
